# bromine-nit-input

The Bromine Elements stands for Brazilian (BR) Localized Elements

`bromine-nit-input` is a Material Design field for entering a valid brazilian NIT/PIS/PASEP code.
Example:

```html
<bromine-nit-input></bromine-nit-input>
```
This component is based on gold-zip-input and I didn't clean the code yet, specially for the license parts.
If I misused the Polymer or Google name, or didn't credit properly some code, please contact-me.
